# CIS3801C_Mobile_Web_Application - Website Design
The purpose of this project is for my CIS3801C Mobile Web Application course. The project entails a webiste that we created to be responsive on different devices and screen sizes such as standard desktop/laptop, smartphones such as Samsung Galaxy S5, iPhone X, and larger mobile devices like an iPad/iPad Pro. The website also utilizes as database on the backend to retain data that is input by someone visiting the website.
# Installation Instructions
Installation is pretty straightforward. There are 6 HTML files to the website itself and one PHP file. index.html, adoptions.html, shop.html, services.html, sales.html, contact.html, and Connect.php all need to be placed in one main folder. There also needs to be an images folder placed into the main folder which contains the image files that are used by the website
# Usage
This website is to be used by a local pet store that will show case different animals that are up for adoption, as well as show some of the pet products, supplies, food/brands, and toys that are for sale at the retail store. There's also information about services offered such as grooming pet care, the prices for the different types of grooming, as well as vet services. The site also allows users to schedule appointments for the vet visit.
